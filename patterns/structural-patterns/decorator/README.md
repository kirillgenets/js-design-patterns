# Decorator

## Wikipedia definition

The **Decorator** pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

## Applicability

You should use the Decorator pattern:

- for dynamic, transparent to customers additions of responsibility to objects;
- for the implementation of duties that may be removed from the facility;
- when the expansion through the creation of subclasses is not possible;
